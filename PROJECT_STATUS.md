- [ ] Document installation process

## 🔧 Reliability Enhancement Options

### Option 1: Daily Reboot (Conservative)
```yaml
# Add to docker-compose.yml
services:
  reboot-scheduler:
    image: alpine
    command: sh -c "echo '0 3 * * * /sbin/reboot' | crontab - && crond -f"
    privileged: true
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Option 2: Service Health Monitoring (Recommended)
- Monitor key metrics in each container
- Log to NDJSON for dashboard visibility
- Alert on anomalies before failures occur

### Option 3: Watchdog Timer (Advanced)
- Hardware watchdog on RPi Zero
- Automatic reboot on system hang
- Requires kernel configuration

## 📊 Monitoring Recommendations

### RPi Zero Specific
1. **CPU Temperature**: `/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp`
   - Warning: >70°C
   - Critical: >80°C

2. **Memory Usage**: `/proc/meminfo`
   - Track available memory
   - Alert if <10MB free

3. **SD Card Health**:
   - Monitor write cycles
   - Check for filesystem errors
   - Log rotation is critical

### Shelly Monitoring
1. **Device Temperature**: Already collected as `device_temp_c`
2. **Uptime**: Track resets/reboots
3. **WiFi Stability**: RSSI and connection state

### Bluetooth Health
1. **Adapter Status**: `hciconfig hci0`
2. **Connection Success Rate**: Track in application logs
3. **Scan Failures**: Already handled with retry logic

## 🎯 Long-term Roadmap

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Post-Installation)
- [ ] Historical data analysis
- [ ] Predictive battery life calculations
- [ ] Solar efficiency tracking
- [ ] Remote configuration updates
- [ ] Multi-vessel fleet management

### Phase 4: Integration Expansion
- [ ] NMEA 2000 gateway
- [ ] SignalK server integration
- [ ] Weather data correlation
- [ ] Anchor watch integration

## 📝 Notes

- Current system has proven stable for 24+ hours
- BLE reliability improvements in v0.2.1 significantly reduced failures
- Daily reboot is optional but could prevent long-term drift
- Focus on monitoring vs. intervention (let services self-heal)
